# Noe's Dotfiles

My dotfiles are heavily inspired by [Luke Smith's dotfiles](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), which I strongly encourage you to check out for more info.

* Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
* Settings for:
    * nvim (text editor)
    * zsh (shell)
    * lf (file manager)
    * mpd/ncmpcpp (music)
    * sxiv (image/gif viewer)
    * mpv (video player)
* Bookmarks in text files used by various scripts
    * File bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
    * Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`

## Usage

These dotfiles are intended to go with numerous suckless programs I use:

* [dwm](https://github.com/thatguynoe/dwm)
* [dwmblocks](https://github.com/thatguynoe/dwmblocks)
* [st](https://github.com/thatguynoe/st)

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/thatguynoe/narbs
cd narbs
sh narbs.sh
```
